ChaosFieldz is a 15-mins battle royale game in a sci-fi style developed fully in C++ in Unreal Engine 5. 40 players will be put in a sci-fi village where they have to collect survival pickups such as water, medkits, backpacks, weapons and grenades that are spread throughout the map. Choosing the right time to deal damage or to hide is the rule of survival.
